<h2>1.Computer Science & Engineering/IT:</h2>
There is always a requirement for a software solution, be it in banking, hospitals, media, airlines, hospitality, IT field, railways, healthcare or education. Computers are the present and the future and there is always demand for an IT expert. Computer Science/IT is one of the most in demand among all the engineering branches. They also have the highest salaries. A student who graduates from any good engineering college in south India, especially from cities like Bangalore, Coimbatore, Chennai or Mangalore can expect to get a very high pay and be placed in one of the top companies in India. A computer science fresher can get a starting salary between Rs. 3 lakh to 8 lakh per annum in most of the metros.
Computer Science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations. If you are interested in computers, if you want to do something new in computers and have very strong mathematical skills along with good IQ, this is the branch that you must choose. Best engineering colleges for computer science engineering are at Bangalore and Coimbatore in South India. It is always advisable to do computer science engineering in Bangalore as there are over 7500+ IT companies there.
<h2>2. Mechanical Engineering:</h2>
Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery. Our country is developing at a rapid pace and is home to several robust heavy-manufacturing industries like steel, metal, forging, automobile and mining. This means all these industries have a demand for a steady inflow of fresh mechanical engineering graduates. As automation is gaining ground, there is an increasing requirement in these industries for engineers who can monitor, supervise and fault-diagnose systems. Not only this, mechanical engineers have scope in the IT sector for designing and developing ERP solutions. Mechanical engineers have a good understanding on of manufacturing and production processes and this makes them indispensable in a large number of sectors.
The top employers of mechanical engineers are sectors such as railways, heavy-engineering, ship yards, ports, mining, defence forces, national highways and metro rail corporation. As cities are developing, there is also development of metro rails to increase connectivity. This is another area that will see huge demand for mechanical engineers. If you have a passion for physics and the functioning of things, building of mechanisms, then this is the branch that you should go for. Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. If you are talented and ready to work hard, there is lot of job opportunity in this sector. It is advisable to complete mechanical engineering in Chennai, Mangalore or Bangalore in south India as these cities are consists of 60% of manufacturing plants in south India.
<h2>3. Electrical & Electronics Engineering:</h2>
This is one of the oldest and core branch of engineering which always had steady demand in terms of employability. All electricity boards, power sector organizations like NTPC, PSUs, railways, defence forces and manufacturing sector have a continuous demand for electrical, electrical & electronic and electrical & instrumentation engineers. Electrical and electronics engineers are also hired in IT sectors for ERP solutions and software development. If you always had an urge to dismantle a switch board, try to figure out the workings of your home’s electrical appliances or your computer’s CPU, then this is the right field for you. There are many job opportunity in government sector for electrical and electronics engineers. Companies like Bosch and BHEL recruit electrical and electronic engineering graduated from engineering colleges in Bangalore, Chennai, Salem, Coimbatore, Erode etc.
<h2>4. Electronics & Communication Engineering:</h2>
In this branch you will study all about electronic circuits, power electronics, fundamentals of communication engineering, signals and systems, applied electromagnetic theory, integrated circuits, digital electronics and logic design VLSI etc. If you are a gadget-nerd, this don’t think twice, this is the branch for you. If you are interested in repairing or developing electronic communication systems, you will not go wrong opting for electronics and communication engineering. There are excellent job opportunities especially in leading companies like Huawei and Ericsson, Recruitments usually are done from leading electronics and communications engineering colleges in Bangalore, Mangalore, Chennai, Cochin, Mangalore, Mysore etc.
<h2>5. Civil Engineering:</h2>
The late nineties and early 2000s saw a sudden boom in infrastructure development leading to an increasing requirement for civil engineers. All construction projects required site engineers, supervisors and architects; fuelling the demand for civil engineers. This branch deals with the construction, designing and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment which includes, roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. It is a very interesting and satisfying profession as you can see the result of your work, whether it is a high-rise building, a hydroelectric dam, a subway station, or a completed bridge. 50% of construction activities are undertaken in tier 1 metro cities, which means, for a civil engineer, the best job opportunities would be in metros across cities. Since companies are also situated in Tier-1 cities, it is better to do civil engineering from Bangalore, Chennai, or Hyderabad as the chances of getting hired are higher. You can also try cities like Coimbatore, Mangalore, Mysore, Cochin etc. as these are rapidly developing Tier 2 cities. Major construction and developers companies like DHL, Ozone group, Embassy group are hiring civil engineering candidates from Bangalore, Chennai and Coimbatore on a large scale.
